# Stack Allocator

This allocator givesyou certainty that all stuff you allocate will be deallocated in proper order - stack-based order.

This class using greedy-programming paradigm, so at the beginnig you have to declarate what is maximum amount of memory you need.

In the files there are lot's of comments made for Visual Studio auto XML documentation, but i don't know how to use it, so if somebody need, and know how to do it, all is prepared.

In main.cpp there are some examples, unfortunately some messages are in Polish (only in main.cpp) but it's really easy to understand why this message is displayed.

If you have any troubles, suggestions or questions mail me:
